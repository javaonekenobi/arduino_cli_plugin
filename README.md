# arduino_cli_plugin
A Maven plugin for the Arduino CLI

this is a very rough attempt to create a maven plugin for the newly released arduino CLI.
At the moment it just handles the sketch compilation.
I only tested it on linux, not sure it will work on other platforms.

It's work in progress, but I hope it's a decent base if anybody feels like extending it or making something better.
